Hello my DJ-ing friends,
 
If your life circumstances are anything like mine, you will probably be finding it progressively more and more 
difficult to find the time to hunt down decent new tunez. In this post-vinyl age 99% of such tunez are to be 
found on-line and when are you ever going to get a spare couple of hours to sit in front of your computer and 
work your way through them in order to mine the gems that are hidden in all that mediocrity? 
 
If this is a situation that sounds familiar to you then perhaps you could make use of 

Matt’s 'mp3 Grabber'
 
I wrote this app to basically move the process of hunting for tunez from being a web based activity to being 
a music player based activity, thus meaning that it can be pursued on the bus/tube/train, whilst walking or 
in the car. It achieves this end with the following functions:

Downloads all mp3 links found on a given webpage (e.g. a music retail site such as TrackItDown or JunoDownload) 
so they can be reviewed at your leisure on any mp3 playing device (e.g. phone or other music player).

Identifies any pages related to the one you have told it about and offers to download the tunez from those pages 
too (so all tunez on the pages with search results 20, 40, 60 etc will also be downloaded).

Identifies any links you've downloaded previously, so you don't end up listening to the same tune more than once.

Identifies any mp3s within your download which look like they are duplicates on the basis of the file name to the 
left of the words 'mix' and 'remix'. This is specifically designed for use with the TrackItDown website, where 
the same tune is often released on multiple labels and the label is given to the right of the file name, 
thus preventing you from ending up listening to the same tune multiple times.

Carries out the same analysis comparing tunez you are proposing to download with tunez you have downloaded on 
previous occasions (so you don’t end up downloading a tune on label x on one occasion and then end up downloading 
the same tune on label y on another occasion).

Automatically sets mp3 tag album information according to your preferences so it is easy to locate the sample 
mp3s you have downloaded on your phone or other music playing device.

Automatically randomizes the files you have downloaded so you don' tend up listening to umpteen different mixes 
of the same tune, or tunez by the same artist, in a row.

Automatically copies your processed mp3s onto your destination device and also makes a backup copy of them on your PC.

Searches directly from the app into my personal favourite download site, TrackItDown.

There are various other features, but I think you should be able to work them out once you start poking around with the app.
 
I’ve only really tested it on TrackItDown, but as it downloads (or attempts to download) any http address found in the 
webpage you point it at which ends in the characters “.mp3”, it should work for most sites which have links to mp3 files on them.
 
I hope it proves to be of some use to you...
 
Big love to you all, and happy spinnin',

Matt
